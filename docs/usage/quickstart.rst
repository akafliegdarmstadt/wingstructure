This document gives a basic overview over the wingstructure package and it's documentation. The package
currently provides three primary more or less connected functions:

 * representation of wing geometry `sfdjk√∂l <../examples/CreateGeometryDict.ipynb>`
 * calculation of lift distribution
 * estimation of wing structure mass (section analysis)

A brief introduction for those functions is given in the associated Jupyter Notebook example files.

Furthermore there are more detailed documentation files linked as well (if existing).

Another source of information is the API documentation :doc:`../reference/modules`
